Privacy Statement

Your privacy is important to us. This mobile app is designed to help keep you safe by alerting you when dangerous animals are nearby. Here's how we handle your data:

What Data We Collect
We do not collect any personal information. The only data we access is your location, which is obtained via the Google Maps API.

How We Use Your Location
Your location is used only to:

Determine if you are near a reported dangerous animal

Send you alerts when you're in proximity to such animals

We do not store your location data on our servers or share it with any third parties.

Animal Reports
We store the location of reported dangerous animals in order to notify nearby users. These reports are removed when it is determined that the animal is no longer present at that location.

Your Control
Because your location is never stored, thereâ€™s nothing for you to delete or manage. You can control app location access via your device settings at any time.

Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, please contact us at cornerofficesoftware@gmail.com.
